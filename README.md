# Space Shooter

A retro-style arcade space shooting game built with **Flutter** and **Flame Engine**.

> **Built with AI**: This game was developed using [self-evolving-agent](https://github.com/miles990/self-evolving-agent)'s `/evolve` skill - an autonomous AI agent that learns and iterates until goals are achieved.

| Spread (SP) | Yellow-Green | Switch to spread weapon |
| Laser (LA) | Cyan | Switch to laser weapon |
| Missile (MI) | Deep Orange | Switch to missile weapon |
| Plasma (PL) | Violet | Switch to plasma weapon |

#### Formation Bonus
| Item | Color | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| Mega Bonus (★) | Gold | +500 score + random power-up |

### Enemy Types (8 Types)

| Type | Shape | Behavior | Spawn Direction |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Basic | Hexagon (Red) | Sine wave movement | Top |
| Fast | Triangle (Orange) | High-speed straight | Top/Diagonal |
| Tank | Square (Gray) | Slow but 3 HP | Top |
| Shooter | Diamond (Purple) | Fires bullets | Top |
| Zigzag | Star (Cyan) | Side-to-side movement | Top |

| **Orbiter** | Circle (Blue) | Orbital movement | Left/Right |

**Spawn Directions**: Top, Left, Right, Top-Left, Top-Right

### Enemy Formations (5 Types)
- **V-Shape**: Classic formation
- **Line**: Horizontal row
- **Circle**: Circular pattern
- **Arrow**: Pointed formation
- **Wave**: Sine wave pattern

**Formation Bonus**: Destroy all enemies in a formation to get guaranteed bonus drops!

### Boss Battles (Enhanced)
- Appears every 5 waves
- **3-Phase difficulty system**:
  - Phase 1 (>70% HP): Basic patterns
  - Phase 2 (40-70% HP): More bullets, faster fire
  - Phase 3 (<40% HP): Enraged mode with spiral attacks
- **Enraged Mode** (<30% HP): Speed boost + aggressive patterns
- Health: 1.5-2x higher than before
- Drops 3 random power-ups on defeat

## Controls

## How This Game Was Built

This project demonstrates **AI-assisted game development** using the self-evolving-agent workflow:

### Step 1: Create Domain Skill
First, a [Flame Engine skill](./skills/flame-game-dev/SKILL.md) was created based on the [Flame Engine documentation](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame). This skill encapsulates:
- Flame architecture patterns (FlameGame, Components, World/Camera)
- Input handling (keyboard, touch, joystick)
- Collision detection system
- Sprite animation patterns
- Audio integration
- Common game patterns (object pooling, spawners, parallax)

### Step 2: Evolve the Game
With the Flame skill in place, the `/evolve` command was used to iteratively build the game:

```bash
/evolve 建立一個太空射擊遊戲
/evolve 加入武器升級和道具掉落系統
/evolve 加入多種敵人類型和 Boss
/evolve 部署到 GitHub Pages
```

The self-evolving-agent autonomously:
- Searched memory for relevant patterns
- Applied Flame Engine best practices from the skill
- Implemented features with proper architecture
- Tested and fixed issues iteratively
- Deployed the final product

### Development Time: ~40 minutes (initial) + ~20 minutes (enhancements)

**Initial build** (~40 minutes):
- Game architecture setup
- Player with 4-level weapon system
- 6 types of power-ups with drop system
- 5 enemy types with unique behaviors
- Boss battle system
- Wave progression
- HUD with lives display
- GitHub Pages deployment

**Enhancement update** (~20 minutes):
- 5 weapon types with unique properties
- 3 new enemy types with multi-directional spawning
- Enhanced Boss with 3-phase difficulty
- 12 power-up types
- Formation bonus system

**Bug fixes** (2026-01-13):
- Fixed Bomb power-up not clearing enemies (recursive search for nested components)
- Added visual confirmation flash effect when Bomb triggers

### Why This Approach?

| Traditional | AI-Assisted |
|-------------|-------------|
| Read docs → Write code → Debug | Skill captures expertise → AI applies patterns |
| Manual iteration | Autonomous PDCA cycles |
| Knowledge in developer's head | Knowledge encoded in reusable skills |
| Hours to days | ~40 minutes |

**Skills are "packaged judgment"** - they tell AI when to use what patterns, reducing decision points and ensuring consistency.
